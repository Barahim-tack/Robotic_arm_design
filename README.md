# Robotic_arm_design
Mechanical designs of the joints of the robot.

In this section, the robotic arm was designed using SolidWorks program. However, the dimensions are not final since they are based on the type and size of the servos used in each joint. Moreover, the first part can be modified to fit the main body of the robot. 

The design consist of 6 main parts, 5 of them (1 - 5) can be printed using plastic materials, while the part 6 with the pins should be made of metal to be stiff enough. 

The design used bearings with a bore of 3 mm and 5 mm that can be modified based on the dimensions and the loads applied.

a vedio is attached in this repositroy to show the process of the assembly as well as a drawing sheet for further details.

The robotic fingers can be applied using an open source design that can be modified later based on the requirements.
